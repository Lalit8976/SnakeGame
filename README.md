# SnakeGame
# SnakeGame is a classic arcade-style game implemented in Java. This project features a playable Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow in size, and avoid 
  colliding with the walls or itself. It is built using Java SE and follows a modular structure suitable for educational purposes, game development practice, and GUI-based project 
 demonstrations. The project uses Apache Ant as the build tool and is structured to integrate with NetBeans, leveraging its default project setup and nbproject directory system.

# The build process includes:

 # Compiling Java source files

# Packaging the application into a JAR

# Running the application via Ant tasks

# Testing and extending with custom Ant targets

# This project is ideal for beginners learning Java game development, basic animation with javax.swing, and understanding how build tools like Ant automate the software development lifecycle.
